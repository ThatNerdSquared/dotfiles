# ThatNerd's Dotfiles

A variety of configurations can be found here, from my neovim config, Ubersicht widgets, installers, quick Python scripts, keybinds, and TWM setup.

Some of the files in here, particularly the install script, are macOS-specific. While I have a side interest in Linux and can see Windows improving, I'm not planning to switch to or daily-drive either of those OSes in the near future, so I'm not adding contingencies for them at the moment.
