      So i was at this summer camp about writing. In the camp everyone gets placed into a group with other people around their age. That year the camp had more girls so my group was all girls except for one guy who left on the second day. 

      The camp was one week so on the last day there was a pizza party and we sat at these large tables with our groups. We're just all eating and one girl is like to the other girls, "Guys rate Nathan". I'm just like "the hell?" And the girls start rating me on a scale of 1 to 10. and then the one sitting next to me is like, "he's kinda hot". and then i died.
